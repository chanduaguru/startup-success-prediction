# startup-success-prediction

A machine learning–powered web application that predicts whether a startup is likely to **succeed or fail** based on key features like funding, location, industry, and more. Designed to assist aspiring entrepreneurs and investors in making informed decisions.

---

Overview

This project uses a trained ensemble of machine learning models to analyze startup data and deliver binary predictions: **Successful** or **Failed**.

Built with a clean Django-based interface, it provides dynamic visualizations and admin control for managing dataset uploads and model selection.

---
